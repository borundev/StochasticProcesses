# StochasticProcesses

This folder contains various chapters explaining topics in stochastic calculus both analytically and computationally using Monte Carlo techniques. The emphasis is on developing a physical understanding using concepts and examples from physics and finance.

As of writing this readme the following chapters are in reasonable shape:

1. [Random Walk and Weiner Process](RandomWalkAndWeinerProcess.ipynb)
2. [Brownian Motion](https://github.com/borundev/StochasticProcesses/blob/master/BrownianMotion.ipynb)
3. [Brownian Motion of Harmonic Oscillator](https://github.com/borundev/StochasticProcesses/blob/master/StochasticHarmonicOscillator.ipynb)
4. [Geometric Brownian Motion and Black-Scholes-Merton model for option pricing](https://github.com/borundev/StochasticProcesses/blob/master/GeometricBrownianMotion_and_EuropeanOptions.ipynb)

The following are incomplete:

1. [Barrier Crossing](https://github.com/borundev/StochasticProcesses/blob/master/BarrierCrossing.ipynb)


Things to do in the near future include:

1. American Options and other exotic options
2. Interest rate models
3. Comparison of real stock returns with geometric Brownian motion
4. Levy flights
