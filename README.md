# StochasticProcesses

This folder contains various chapters explaining topics in stochastic calculus both analytically and computationally using Monte Carlo techniques. The emphasis is on developing a physical understanding using concepts and examples from physics and finance.

As of writing this readme the following chapters are in reasonable shape:

1. Random Walk and Weiner Process
2. Brownian Motion


Things to do in the near future include

1. Brownian motion in harmonic oscillator
2. Black-Scholes model of stock movement
3. Option pricing using the model
4. Interest rate models
