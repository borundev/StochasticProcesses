# StochasticProcesses

This folder contains various chapters explaining topics in stochastic calculus both analytically and computationally using Monte Carlo techniques. The emphasis is on developing a physical understanding using concepts and examples from physics and finance.

As of writing this readme the following chapters are in reasonable shape:

1. Random Walk and Weiner Process [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")
2. Brownian Motion
3. Brownian Motion of Harmonic Oscillator


Things to do in the near future include

1. Black-Scholes model of stock movement
2. Option pricing using the model
3. Interest rate models
